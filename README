Main.py is the main program for running the project.

HSV.py is a supplmentary program from https://toptechboy.com/tracking-an-object-based-on-color-in-opencv/ which allows a user to
find an appropriate range of HSV values for specific colour detection. Modified to find pixel coordinates of centroids of objects.
Can be used for finding HSV ranges needed for ring task in Main.py.

Two Camera HSV.py is a modified version of HSV.py that implements the same functionality as HSV.py, but with two cameras to allow
for 3D object tracking. Attempting to combine two sets of 2D coordinates into one 3D coordinate set.

3D plot test.py was for experimening with the matplotlib library and 3D plotting an array of points.
